## CloudPebble Portable

Simplified reincarnation of CloudPebble. Create, debug and package Pebble apps and watchfaces.

CloudPebble Portable is aiming to be small and self-contained. The application is distributed as a single executable based on [redbean web server](https://redbean.dev). The size is ~10MB at the moment, but in order to compile your watch app, it will need to download additional ~125MB archive, which unpacks to ~400MB (this is still quite small comparing to other options, e.g. available Docker images are almost 1GB _compressed_).

### Status

**Work in progress**. Not ready yet.

- [x] 游릭 Editing source files works: you can create, edit, rename, delete, etc.
- [x] 游릭 Editing resources works
- [ ] 游댮 Code completion doesn't work
- [ ] 游리 Compilation works partially:
    - [ ] 游리 on Windows (via WSL and chroot)
        - [x] 游릭 Pebble C SDK
        - [x] 游릭 PebbleJS
        - [ ] 游댮 Pebble Package
        - [ ] 游댮 RockyJS
    - [ ] 游댮 on MacOS
    - [ ] 游댮 on Linux
- [ ] 游리 Emulator works partially:
    - [ ] 游리 on Windows (via WSL and chroot) - see 'Known bugs'
    - [ ] 游댮 on MacOS
    - [ ] 游댮 on Linux
- [ ] 游댮 Dependencies management not implemented yet
- [ ] 游댮 Project settings not implemented yet

#### Known bugs

- In Emulator on Windows, DNS resolution doesn't work for PebbleKit JS apps. Workaround is to put necessary hosts manually to %USERPROFILE%/.pebble/pebblesdk-container/rootfs/etc/hosts

### Usage

Download the `cloudpebble-portable.com` executable from **Releases**. Drop it into your watch app folder (i.e. where your `appinfo.json` or `package.json` resides) and run. The browser will pop up, showing CloudPebble interface.

### Development

Run `./init.sh` (one-time): it downloads redbean server and zip tool binaries from https://redbean.dev/ and puts them into `base` folder.

Run `./build.sh`. It adds the source files into redbean executable. Result will appear in the `dist` folder.

Then you can put some Pebble watchapp or watchface project into the dist folder, cd there and run `./cloudpebble-portable.com`.

I usually do `cd dist` and then `../build.sh && ./cloudpebble-portable.com` from there.
Then test it by navigating to `http://localhost:8080`. Then if we made some more changes and need to refresh, `Ctrl+D` and run same command again.
